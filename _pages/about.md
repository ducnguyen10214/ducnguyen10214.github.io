I’m a junior at UC Berkeley with a strong passion in programming and engineering, especially in backend engineering, e.g. distributed systems, database management systems, and computer security. As an ambitious and motivated individual, I yearn for opportunities to broaden my horizons, make self-improvements through multiple challenges as well as contribute to the future of technology and the humanity.

Besides studying, in my free time, I enjoy building projects, solving coding problems, and reading documentations of some applications that I recently have my eyes on!

As of right now, I’m actively looking for opportunities to challenge myself in a professional working environment where I can make contributions based on my capabilities and extend my perspective about the software engineering industry.
